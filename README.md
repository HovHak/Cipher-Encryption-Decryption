### Cipher Encryption Decryption
 
## My Cipher

------


My algorithm implements two different encrypting/decrypting approaches in which the English letters of plaintext are mapped together into a cipher text. As part of creating my own cipher I have decided to unite monoalphabetic and transposition techniques that will map a perfect cipher that would be hard to decrypt even if the key would be available to a third-party user. My algorithm is based on 3 stages that work sequentially which makes it complex yet simple for a small encryption/decryption algorithm. First stage consist of applying affine method for encryption. Second stage, generating third key to improve affine, applying rivers transposition to the cipher text.
